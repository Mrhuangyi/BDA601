# Module 8

## Linear Regression
In Module 6, you learned about classification problems. Classification and regression are similar in the sense that both attempt to predict the value of a variable of interest from a given set of dependent variables. The major difference between classification and regression is that while classification attempts to predict the value of a categorical variable, regression seeks to estimate the value of a numeric variable.

## Learning Activity 1: Working with DataFrame and Functions in PySpark

1. [Download Traffic Crash Dataset](1.Download_Dataset/README.md)

2. [Initialize File structure](2.Initialize/README.md)
   
3. [Install Pyspark](3.Install_Pyspark/README.md)

In Jupyter Notebook, using PySpark, perform the following:

- Load the data from the csv files into DataFrames.
- Find the ratio of number of crashes where the person involved was using cell phone to that where the person was not using the cell phone.
- Find which three Age groups were involved with highest number of crashes.
- Find which month of the year has the highest crashes.
- Find which day of the week has the least crashes.

# Pymongo
This Module is intended as an introduction to working with MongoDB and PyMongo.

## Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure that you have the PyMongo distribution installed. In the Python shell, the following should run without raising an exception:

```
>>> import pymongo
```

This tutorial also assumes that a MongoDB instance is running on the default host and port. Assuming you have [downloaded and installed MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

## Making a Connection with MongoClient
The first step when working with **PyMongo** is to create a MongoClient to the running mongod instance. Doing so is easy:

```
>>> from pymongo import MongoClient
>>> client = MongoClient()
```
The above code will connect on the default host and port. We can also specify the host and port explicitly, as follows:

```
>>> client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
```

Or use the MongoDB URI format:

```
>>> client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
```

## Getting a Database
A single instance of MongoDB can support multiple independent databases. When working with PyMongo you access databases using attribute style access on MongoClient instances:

```
>>> db = client.test_database
```

If your database name is such that using attribute style access wonâ€™t work (like test-database), you can use dictionary style access instead:

```
>>> db = client['test-database']
```

## Getting a Collection
A collection is a group of documents stored in MongoDB, and can be thought of as roughly the equivalent of a table in a relational database. Getting a collection in PyMongo works the same as getting a database:

```
>>> collection = db.test_collection
```

or (using dictionary style access):

```
>>> collection = db['test-collection']
```

An important note about collections (and databases) in MongoDB is that they are created lazily - none of the above commands have actually performed any operations on the MongoDB server. Collections and databases are created when the first document is inserted into them.

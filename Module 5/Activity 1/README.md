#### Learning Activity 1: Hands-on Exercise—Data Exploration using PySpark

In this activity, you will perform both a visual and statistical exploratory analysis to gain insights into a data set. Using the Bank Marketing dataset (bank.csv), which is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing#:%7E:text=UCI%20Machine%20Learning%20Repository%3A
%20Bank%20Marketing%20Data%20Set&text=Abstract%3A%20The%20data%20is%20related,term%20deposit
%20(variable%20y)*, you are required to perform the following tasks using PySpark:

Calculate the mean, median and standard deviation of all the variables/attributes of ‘numeric’ type;
Create a bar graph of the variable/attribute: previous;
Create a normalised bar graph of the variable/attribute: previous;
Create a histogram of the variable/attribute: age;
Create a histogram of the normalised variable/attribute: age;
Bin the variable/attribute age and create a bar chart;
Create a scatter plot for the following variables/attributes: age and balance;
Use the discussion forum entitled ‘Data Exploration using PySpark’ to present your collective findings from the statistics and visuals that you produced above. In your own words, share and detail as many insights from the statistics and visuals as you consider important. For example, you may wish to state:
What the mean, median and standard deviation of age indicate about the individual employment status listed under the ‘Job’ column; and
What trend you see in the bar graph generated using the ‘Previous’ column; and
Provide feedback about other students’ findings.

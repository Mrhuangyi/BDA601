#### Learning Activity 1: Hands-on Exercise - Working with DataFrame and Functions in PySpark

1. Download Traffic Crash Dataset

Download the Traffic Crash Dataset, consisting of three csv files, Traffic Crashes – Crashes, Traffic Crashes – Vehicles and Traffic Crashes – People, from the City of Chicago website.

2. Find useful information using PySpark DataFrame API and Built-in functions

In Jupyter Notebook, using PySpark, perform the following:

Load the data from the csv files into DataFrames.
Find the ratio of number of crashes where the person involved was using cell phone to that where the person was not using the cell phone.
Find which three Age groups were involved with highest number of crashes.
Find which month of the year has the highest crashes.
Find which day of the week has the least crashes.
